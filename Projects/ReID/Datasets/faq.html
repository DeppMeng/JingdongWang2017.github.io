            <h4>Q: What are images beginning with "0000" and "-1" in Market-1501? </h4>

                A: Names beginning with "0000" are distractors produced by DPM false detection.
                Names beginning with "-1" are junks that are neither good nor bad DPM bboxes.
                So "0000" will have a negative impact on accuracy, while "-1" will have no impact.
                During testing, we rank all the images in "bounding_box_test". Then, the junk images are just neglected; distractor images are not neglected.

            <h4>Q: How exactly do we use images in the "gt_bboxes" during training and testing in Market-1501? </h4>

                A: gt_bboxes are not used in training and testing now. These hand-drawn images are used to calculate the IOU (intersection over union) with the DPM bboxes, so that "good", "distractor", and "junk" can be assigned to the DPM bboxes.

            <h4>Q: Do you have some results for full hand labeled version of the dataset (images from gt_bboxes) in Market-1501?</h4>

                A: Not yet. We only have the results on the DPM bboxes. One may want to try it. It is pretty interesting.
